# Sports Analytics RAG System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Vision
Build an advanced sports analytics RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that provides intelligent, context-aware responses to complex sports queries using cutting-edge AI technologies.

### Mission
Create a system that can decompose complex sports questions, retrieve relevant information from a comprehensive sports database, and generate accurate, well-cited responses that help users understand sports analytics at a deeper level.

## Core Features

### 1. Query Decomposition
- **Purpose**: Break down complex, multi-part sports questions into atomic sub-questions
- **Example**: "Which team has the best defense and how does their goalkeeper compare to the league average?" â†’ 
  - "Which team has the best defense?"
  - "How does their goalkeeper compare to the league average?"

### 2. Advanced Retrieval System
- **Contextual Compression**: Compress retrieved documents to focus on relevant information
- **Semantic Reranking**: Re-rank results based on relevance to the specific query
- **Multi-modal Retrieval**: Support for text, statistics, and structured data

### 3. Intelligent Response Generation
- **Citation-based Responses**: Every answer includes source citations
- **Multi-part Answer Aggregation**: Combine answers from decomposed queries
- **Context-aware Responses**: Responses adapt to the specific context of the query

### 4. FastAPI Backend
- **RESTful API**: Clean, documented endpoints
- **Async Support**: Handle multiple concurrent requests
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **LLM**: Groq API (replacing OpenAI)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone
- **Embeddings**: Nomic embeddings
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Document Processing**: LangChain document loaders and splitters

### System Components

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Document loading and preprocessing
   - Text chunking and embedding generation
   - Vector storage in Pinecone

2. **Query Processing Engine**
   - Query decomposition using Groq LLM
   - Contextual compression and reranking
   - Multi-step retrieval process

3. **Response Generation System**
   - RAG chain with citation tracking
   - Answer aggregation for complex queries
   - Response formatting and validation

4. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI endpoints for query processing
   - Request/response handling
   - Error management and logging

## Data Requirements
