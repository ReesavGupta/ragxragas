# Strategic Decision Engine - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Problem Statement
CEOs and business leaders need a comprehensive, AI-powered platform to analyze internal and external data, generate strategic insights, and support data-driven decision-making. Current tools lack deep document understanding, hybrid retrieval, and explainable, citation-based recommendations.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Enable company leaders to upload and process diverse business documents (reports, financials, market research).
- Provide intelligent, explainable strategic recommendations (e.g., SWOT, market expansion) with source citations.
- Support complex query decomposition and advanced retrieval (dense + sparse, reranking).
- Visualize insights with charts and tables.
- Evaluate output quality using RAGAS (Faithfulness, Relevancy, Precision, Recall, Correctness).

## 3. User Stories
- As a CEO, I want to upload company documents and financials to build a knowledge base.
- As a strategist, I want to ask complex business questions and receive decomposed, well-cited answers.
- As a user, I want to see visualizations (charts, tables) of key insights and recommendations.
- As an analyst, I want to evaluate the quality of AI-generated responses using RAGAS metrics.

## 4. Core Features
- **Document Upload & Processing:** PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT
- **Text Extraction & Chunking:** Preprocessing pipeline
- **Hybrid RAG Retrieval:** Dense (Pinecone) + Sparse (BM25/Redis) + Reranking (multi-model)
- **Query Decomposition:** Break down complex queries for granular analysis
- **Contextual Compression:** Filter and compress relevant context
- **Citation-based Responses:** Source tracking for all recommendations
- **Tool Calling:** Integrate market/financial APIs for real-time data
- **Visualization:** Charts, tables, dashboards (Streamlit/React)
- **Caching:** Redis for embeddings, results, sessions
- **Evaluation:** RAGAS framework for output quality

## 5. Technical Requirements
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (MVP), React (future)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB (metadata), Pinecone (vector DB)
- **Caching:** Redis
- **LLMs:** Multiple (e.g., Groq, OpenAI, local)
- **Libraries:** langchain-nomic, langchain-community, langchain-pinecone, langchain_groq, ragas
- **Deployment:** Docker, cloud-ready

## 6. Architecture Overview
- **Document Processing Pipeline:** Extraction → Chunking → Embedding → Storage
- **Retrieval Pipeline:** Hybrid search (dense + sparse) → Reranking → Context compression
- **LLM Orchestration:** Query decomposition, tool calling, response generation
- **Evaluation:** RAGAS metrics on generated answers
- **Frontend:** Dashboard for upload, query, visualization, evaluation

## 7. Evaluation Criteria
- **Faithfulness:** Are answers grounded in source docs?
- **Relevancy:** Are answers relevant to the query?
- **Context Precision/Recall:** Is the right context used?
- **Correctness:** Are answers factually correct?
